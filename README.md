# Connect 4
This was a project I made as my course culminating activity for my grade 12 computer science class, hope you enjoy. 
This repo will contain an exe file for a connect four application, made using pygame. 
It will also contain a fully commented out .py file containing the code for this application 
If running the .py file be sure to pip install pygame as well as numpy
